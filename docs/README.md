# Welcome

As a new user, the [getting started guide](intro/getting-started.md) is a good place to start, then perhaps moving on to [the FAQ](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/faq.html#faq). If you run into trouble getting devices to connect to each other, the page about [firewall setup](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/firewall.html#firewall-setup) explains the networking necessary to get it to work.

As a developer looking to get started with a contribution, see [how to build](https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/building.html#building), [how to debug](https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/debugging.html#debugging) and the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). This documentation site can be edited on [Github](https://github.com/syncthing/docs).
